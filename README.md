# ABRA IDA 2024
 This project implements a ship control system using MAVLink and Pymavlink. It leverages computer vision to detect buoys and control the ship's movements based on the detected objects. The main components of the project include a detector for identifying colored buoys and a control library for managing the ship's operations.
